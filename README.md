pyormish
========

An ORM-ish Python utility, designed to work with existing databases.

## Discontinued. 

SQLAlchemy, in the past year or two, has begun to support pre-existing databases better, Python 3.x, and is just a more solid library in general. PeeWee has also gained some steam. Rather than continue to support a framework that no longer serves a niche market, I think it makes sense to gracefully bow out. Thanks for all the support!
